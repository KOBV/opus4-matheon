# OPUS 4

OPUS 4 is an open source software under the GNU General Public Licence for the operation of intitutional document
servers and repositories. OPUS is an acronym for **O**nline **P**ublikationsverbund **U**niversity **S**tuttgart.
It was originally developed at the university library in Stuttgart at the end of the 90's. OPUS 4 is a complete
redevelopment that was created as part of a DFG ([Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft][DFG]) project between 2008 and 2010.
Since then the development has been continued at KOBV ([Kooperativer Bibliotheksverbund Berlin-Brandenburg][KOBV])
mostly.

## OPUS 4 at GitHub

<<<<<<< HEAD
NOTE: Although the main different to a regular OPUS 4 installation is the layout for Matheon, this is a full fork of the OPUS 4 application. As development progresses it might be possible to create OPUS 4 layout modules that can be added to any OPUS 4 installation using Composer.
=======
In 2015 the development was moved to GitHub in order to better support collaboration in the continued development
efforts. The first OPUS 4 version developed at GitHub is 4.5. Starting with this version OPUS 4 should be installed
using Git, since this will make updates for bug fixes and new features easier. More information can be found online.

## Previous (non-GitHub) Version:

The last non-Git release of OPUS 4 is Version 4.4.5 and can be [downloaded][OPUS445] from the
[OPUS 4 Homepage][OPUS4] as a tarball. The [documentation][OPUS445DOC] for this version can
be found there as well.
Version 4.4.5 can be installed without Git. It is recommended to use the GitHub version of
OPUS 4 for setting up new repositories. However if you are looking at migrating an existing OPUS 3
repository to OPUS 4 using this version would currently be a necessary step since there is at the moment
no working migration script for the Git version.
